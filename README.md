## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

- Scroll Magik is a new library that will make your website alive 😀
- with only one data attribute you can do a lot with less code 😌

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Nothing required to start using it , just put it right in your files and that's it 🥳

```
<div data-scroll="fade-up 1s hide">
  <h1>code here...</h1>
</div>

```

### Installing

- You can download an offline copy for you project 📴 , just by clicking Download Zip up above 👆👆

Or

- you can use npm to install it , run the line below in your machine command line (need Node.js to be installed ) 📁📁

```
npm install scroll-aniamtions --save
```

OR

- You can use the CDN links below and include it directly to your project 🔗🔗

```
link.css
```

```
link.min.css
```

```
link.scss
```

```
link.js
```

```
link.min.js
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

- After downloading files or adding CDN links , Add the data-scroll attribute to any element of your HTML code
  example :

```
<div data-scroll="fade-up 1s hide">
 <h1>code here...</h1>
</div>
```

## 🎈 Options <a name="options"></a>

- version 1.0.0 comes with limited options for this library for now for sure 😌😀

- So How to Edit it ?

```
data-scroll='fade-up 2s hide'
```

- in order to work properly you need to add at least one property in the data-scroll attr and that would be the animation behavior like "fade-up , slide-up , blur ... etc "
  see all examples on here [Scroll Magik Examples](https://scroll.abdoseadaa.com/examples/)

Example for one property

```
data-scroll='fade-up'
```

- By default animation duration is 1.5 seconds , but if you want to change it you can do it easily by adding second property beside the animation behavior like so 👇👇

```
data-scroll='fade-up .5s'
```

- If you want the parent element of the selected element to have over-flow hidden add so element start the animation on it's container only you need to add "hide" beside the duration property , like so 👇

```
data-scroll='fade-up .5s hide'

```

- And thats is for now , more features is coming with upper versions🥳😌✨🎉
